INTRO TO MYSQL

Database Advantages:
	safe, reliable, fast, and convenient way to persist massive amounts of data to be used and updated by multiple users and applications

	the world runs on databases

Data Model:
	a way data is stored. MySQL organizes data in a relational model

Relational Model:
	a data model wwhere data is organized into relations (tables) that are very similar to spreadsheets

	it is the most widely used data model used among Database Management Systems

	a DMS that uses a relational model is known as Relational Database Management System

RDBMS
	a piece of software to organize and manage a database using the relational model

MySQL
	RDBMS
	free
	open source
	widely used by small companies and some enterprise market share

SQL "Structured Query Language"
	a "declarative" language to tell the RDBMS what you want without telling it how to do it

SQL exercise resources

Subsets of SQL to explore we will explore in the coming lessons:
	DDL "Data Definition Languge" SQL syntax to create and manipulate databases and tables
	DCL "Data Control Language" SQL syntax to create and manipulate users and user access
	DML "Data Manipulation Language" - SQL syntax to create, update and delete data in a database
    DQL "Data Query Language" - SQL syntax to search for specific data in a database

MYSQL CLIENT AND EXERCISE

Logging in...
	from inside your vagrant environment:
		1. type "mysql -u vagrant -p"
		2. press enter
		3. type "vagrant" as your password
		4. press enter

Help menu...
	at any time, access the help menu by typing "help". see a help menu of topics by typing "help contents"

Exit MySQL client...
	type "exit" to exit the client

Format client output...
	most SQL commands end with a semicolon " ; "

	to see results formatted in a different way, end the query with " \G "


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



MySQL application will run on the same server as the server side programming language


MYSQL USERS AREN'T THE SAME THING AS APPLICATION'S USERS
	MySQL users are users/connections authorized to manipulate the database

	scenario is 3 apps on the same server:
		todo, craigslist, dating app
			TODO
				user called todo_user
				GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON todo_db.* TO 'todo_user'@'192.168.77.1';

			for the craigslist app, we'll have a mysql user called craigslist_user
			for the dating app, we'll have a mysql user called dating_user
		each application should have it's own user that only has access to that application's database


'mysql' or 'database' to mean the database system, or a specific database
	mysql has multiple databases
	ech database will have multiple tables
		blog_posts
		id, title, body, created_at, modified_at
		1, hello world, lorem ipsum.../ 2017-04-03...

		data or facts live on tables
		tables live inside of databases




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


MYSQL TABLES

columns have data types:
	id, username, password, etc
rows have fields (whatever data that we give the particular entry)

integer data type:
	a normal INT type goes from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648
	an unsigned INT means only positive numbers 4,294,967,296


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You do not have to specify every column in your table, but the set of values must match up exactly with the set of columns.


read entire table
	SELECT * FROM albums\G

delete entire table
	TRUNCATE albums;

insert single values for all columns
	INSERT INTO albums (artist, name, release_date, sales, genre) values ("Fall Out Boy", "Dance, Dance", 2007, 2000000, "Punk");
